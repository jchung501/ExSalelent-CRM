## Challenges

The most challenging part of this project was creating a route for my search feature that would query through my entire collection and find any customer that has that certain make of car within their interests. It was soon figured out that my Results.jsx was rendering incorrectly. 

## How to Use

The user would need to signup if a login isn't already made. Once logged in, the user is able to add a new customer into the database, and just fill in their information as directed. The user can then include all the customers interests within the interests field and separate those by commas, once completed, just submit and the customer is all setup and in the system!
